Code used to run simulations for fMRI response time modeling paper, "The response time paradox in functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses" by Mumford, Bissett, Jones, Shim, Rios and Poldrack.

functions.py: main functions used
group_cor_rt.py: Code used to run group correlation simulations
group_type1_err_by_rtdiff.py: Code for analyzing type I errors in group analyses (1-sample t-tests)
simulation_settings_fc.py: Simulation settings used to reflect the Grinband Forced Choice response times
simulation_settings_stroop.py: Simulation settings used to reflect the Stroop RTs
Note, parameters for forced choice and stroop based simulations were set to yield similar effect sizes
